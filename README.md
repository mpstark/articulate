# Articulate
Articulate is a custom written voice control program designed for ArmA. It makes controlling your squad simply a matter of saying what you wish them to do.

For example, instead of having to remember that the **Open Fire** command for your whole squad is `~ 3 1` you can simply say "All, open fire".

For more information on the commands currently available, take a look at the wiki's [commands](https://github.com/Mpstark/articulate/wiki/Commands) page.

## Download
You can download the latest development preview of Articulate [here](https://github.com/Mpstark/articulate/wiki/Development-Preview). Please keep in mind that, being a development preview, it is likely to have bugs and may crash/hinder gameplay. We ask that you be patient, report any issues you encounter and give us the chance to develop the application you are looking for.

## Advantages
Compared to other voice recognition solutions, Articulate offers the following advantages.

- Only accepts valid commands
- Doesn't require pauses between sections of a command
- Tailored to ArmA's command menu
- Completely Free

## Usage
You will generally be able to use Articulate by giving the same commands your in-game character gives to his squad. This means that you are able to give commands like "Squad, Open Fire" and Articulate will understand exactly what you mean.

For a full list of available commands, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Mpstark/articulate/wiki/Commands).
